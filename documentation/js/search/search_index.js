 \n\nResearch Hub Web\nThe front end for the Research Hub, built with Angular and Angular Material.\nDeveloping\nFollow steps 1 and 2 in the research-hub-deploy README.\nTo experience the full functionality of the app, you also need to run research-hub-api and research-hub-db whilst developing. \nFollow the instructions on the following pages:\n\nresearch-hub-db: run the database using Docker\nresearch-hub-api: run the api directly with Maven or via the IntelliJ IDE\n\nNavigate to the research-hub-web folder (this command assumes you're in the research-hub-deploy folder):\ncd build/research-hub-webInstall dependencies:\nnpm installThen run npm run start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you \nchange any of the source files.\nTo test run the app in production mode, run npm run test-prod.\nCode scaffolding\nRun npm run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use npm run ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module.\nBuild\nRun npm run build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. \nBuild production and use webpack bundle analyzer\nRun npm run build-prod to build the project in production mode.\nYou can also visualise the size of the webpack output files with webpack bundle analyzer, \nan interactive zoomable treemap. To do this, once the build has finished, run npm run bundle-report.\nRunning unit tests\nRun npm run test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun npm run e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nBefore running the tests make sure you are serving the app via npm run start.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use npm run ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nCopyright (c) 2017 The Centre for eResearch, The University of Auckland\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
